# Cookie Clicker Script Extender (CCSE)

**CCSE** is a modding framework for the game <code>https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/</code>. On its own, it makes no changes to the game. Instead, it makes modding the game much easier.

The vanilla game has a couple mod hooks in it already. However, they are labelled as primitive and according to the changelog have been that way since they were introduced in 2014.
